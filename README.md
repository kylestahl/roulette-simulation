# Roulette Simulation
Simulating the casino game Roulette and a comparing a few popular strategies

This is version 1 of a roulette simulation I did for a school project back in 2014. I plan on eventually re-working it in python/R and creating a cleaner version.
This compares a few different betting strategies such as: covering a certain percentage of the board, Martingale, Labouch√®re, The Dopey System, and The Red System.

Final conclusion is if you want to maximize your money, is not to play roulette.
